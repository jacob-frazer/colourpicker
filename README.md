# Colour picker web app built using LLM code gen

I have built this basic colour picker app to serve 2 purposes. Firstly I didn't like how when selecting pallettes or combinations of colours on existing colour picker apps you didn't get a good preview of what they were like. Secondly, and mainly, I built this as I have been using it as a means to test how chatGPT and other LLMs can aid my dev process.
